Triangulated Irregular Network 
Vector-based representation of a surface.
TINs are commonly used in terrain representation 
But usable for  representing other variables which can be as surfaces.
TINs consist a series of contiguous, non-overlapping triangles that are known as faces.
Created from  a series of points using a technique called Delaunay triangulation
TINs are also used to construct Thiessen polygons, which form the basis for interpolating to areas.
